1. Working Days & Weekly Offs

The standard working days for the company are Monday through Friday, with Saturdays and Sundays designated as weekly offs.

1.1 Non-Standard Working Days

Certain roles may require non-standard working days, including:

Six-Day Workweek: Employees in roles that necessitate six working days will be informed at the time of hiring or upon transitioning to a new role. Such employees will receive one week off instead of the usual two.
Uneven Work Distribution: For roles with variable workloads, employees may work on weekends, receiving their weekly off on designated weekdays. The specific schedule will be determined through discussions with management and HR.
1.2 Compensatory Offs (Comp Offs)

Employees may be eligible for Comp Offs if they work on weekends or holidays due to critical project demands. To qualify for Comp Offs:

The additional work must result from an unexpected increase in workload, not employee inefficiency.
The leave must be taken within one month following the extra day worked.
All requests for Comp Offs require prior approval from the employee's Reporting Manager and Functional Head, followed by submission to HR.
2. Working Hours & Break Time

Employees are expected to complete a total of nine working hours each day. The standard working hours are from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM, with flexibility allowed for completing the nine hours.

Employees are entitled to a one-hour break during their working hours, which may be taken in one continuous period or split as needed.
3. Attendance

Employees are required to log their attendance by using the biometric system at the entrance. Failure to do so will result in the absence being recorded as Loss of Pay (LOP).
Attendance records will be maintained in the HRMS.
For employees working from home, attending conferences, or engaged in shoots, they must log their status as “On Duty” in the HRMS, selecting the appropriate category. Managerial approval is necessary; otherwise, the absence will be recorded as LOP.
If an employee forgets to mark their attendance, they can request attendance regularization within one week via the HRMS. Any discrepancies reported after this period will be classified as absence and recorded as leave without pay.
Employees with attendance-related queries should contact the HR department at gtet.attendance@narayanagroup.com.
4. Work From Home (WFH) Policy

4.1 General WFH Guidelines

Employees may work from home for valid reasons, with a maximum of two days per work month, subject to prior approval from their Reporting Manager.
Female employees will be entitled to additional one Work from Home (WFH) under the AFL for women's health-related concerns
4.2 Specific WFH Categories

Medical Reasons: Employees incapacitated for travel due to medical issues must provide a medical certificate and request WFH approval before the intended work-from-home period.
Unsafe Conditions: Requests to work from home due to extreme weather or other unsafe conditions must be submitted via formal email to Reporting Manager and Functional Head, who will assess the situation.
Discretionary Reasons: For personal circumstances requiring WFH, employees should submit their requests at least 48 hours in advance to their respective Reporting Manager and Functional Head keeping HR on cc.
4.3 WFH Expectations

When working from home, employees are expected to:

Log WFH in the HRMS and communicate their availability for meetings clearly.
Attend all scheduled meetings and respond to calls promptly within one hour.
Submit a work plan at the beginning of the day and an end-of-day progress update to their manager.
4.4 Extension of WFH

Requests for additional WFH days beyond the standard two must be approved via email by both the Reporting Manager and Functional Head. Requests affecting workflow may be denied.

5. Absenteeism from Work

Absenteeism, defined as unapproved or uninformed absence, includes:

Consecutive absences of three or more days without notification or approved leave.
Sick leave taken without prior communication to the Reporting Manager.
Last-minute extensions of approved leave beyond the designated period.
Uninformed absences will be treated as leave without pay during payroll processing. Failure to report back after an absentee period may lead to termination of employment if not addressed within 48 hours of HR notification.

6. Compliance

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including deductions for Loss of Pay.

7. Right to Amendment

The organization reserves the right to amend, suspend, or withdraw this policy at any time without prior notice.

Employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with this policy to ensure compliance and maintain a productive work environment.
